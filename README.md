# COVID-19_Contact_Network_Model

This code and data are used to power a [Shiny App](https://z.umn.edu/LINCS).
While the app is fully functional and contains some documentation, this repository will
serve for a more comprehensive description of the underlying data, model, parameters, etc,
as well as an open-source repository for the code used to run the simulations presented
in the app. That said, this is very much a work-in-progress and the current state of the
code is far less annotated than desired.

Any help in terms of identifying bugs, typos, or sources of confusion would be greatly
appreciated, and can either be opened as issues here or sent to me via email at michalsm@umn.edu.

Thank you also for your understanding during the development of this repository for public use.
