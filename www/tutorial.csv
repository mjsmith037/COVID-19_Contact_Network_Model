1,#step1,"This tutorial will walk you through how to use the app. If you prefer to explore on your own, you can exit this tutorial at any time by clicking “Skip” or anywhere outside this text bubble. You can always come back to this tutorial by clicking the purple Tutorial button in the bottom left of the parameter pane.",right
2,#step2,"In this pane, you can set the parameters for the disease simulation. The ranges have been set according to literature estimates for COVID-19.",right
3,#step3,"For example, this slider adjusts the transmission rate of the disease. This can be thought of as the probability of a susceptible individual getting infected by their infectious neighbor in a given timestep (one day in this model).",bottom
4,#step4,"Some parameters are more intuitively defined by their <a href=”https://www.mathsisfun.com/reciprocal.html”>reciprocal</a>. Here, the reciprocal of the probability of getting better in a given timestep corresponds the the average length of time it takes for someone to recover from the disease.",bottom
5,#step5,"Once you have adjusted all of the parameters you would like to change, click this button to re-run the simulation and generate new output.",right
6,#step6,"The simulation does two things: first, it generates a network of interactions, shown here. Each dot represents a person and the lines between them indicate interactions that facilitate transmission. The lines are colored according to the type of interaction the two people had. While this is just a random network with only one generic type of interaction, in the following tabs, the networks will be generated to simulate a community with realistic interaction patterns.",right
7,#step7,"We then simulate disease spread on this network, and summarize the epidemic with this pane. As time goes on, moving from left to right across the plot, we see the lines go up as more people get infected, and then go back down as they recover or die. You can also view this information as proportions of the total population by clicking the corresponding tab above this plot.",left
