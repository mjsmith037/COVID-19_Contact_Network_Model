This tab is designed to to introduce users to the basics of this COVID-19
disease model. By opening (or closing) the latter three expandable sections on
the left, you can add or remove type of interactions from the network.
Additionally, within each expansion are parameters particular to the specified
type of interaction.

In the next tab, we will explore particular trade-off scenarios faced by
policymakers, but first, it is important to understand how the underlying
choices (parameters) for modeling disease transmission also affect model
outcomes. In any model, there is uncertainty in model parameters and that is
especially true when dealing with a new disease like COVID-19, where only a
small number of studies have been published. We have preemptively set the
disease parameters to the current best estimates from the published literature,
but remember that uncertainty in these values can affect simulated outcomes.

**Note**: Parameters adjusted here will sync with the following (scenario) tab, and *vice versa*.
