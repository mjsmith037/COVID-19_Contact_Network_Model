# Thanks for visiting our App!

Throughout each day, we interact with others in a variety of ways and contexts.
This tool is designed to investigate how the relative strength/frequency of
these interactions affects the spread of COVID-19. For example, in a single
household, we see individuals interacting a lot with other members of their
household, but (especially when there isn't a lockdown) there are also
interactions at school or work and even brief interactions at the grocery store
or with delivery people. So if we are going to move out of lockdown, which
interactions have the biggest impact on disease spread? If we open schools, but
keep people home from work, does that lead to more disease spread than if we did
the reverse? You can play with the model here to explore these kinds of
questions.

Keep in mind these simulations are not meant to represent predictions of actual
outbreak sizes, but instead to demonstrate the relative effects of different
social behaviors on COVID-19 transmission.

Finally, we appreciate your patience as we continue to improve this app.
Feedback is very welcome, and can be sent along with any questions or concerns
to michalsm@umn.edu.
