The objective of this scenario is to show how school-age children
attending school (as in the previous scenario) interacts with adults going
to work to affect COVID-19 transmission outcomes.

In this scenario, users can vary school/classroom transmission as in the
"Household-Merging vs. School" scenario. In addition, users can now
vary parameters related to adults going to work in shared work
environments (i.e. NOT working remotely). In this scenario, adults
of working age (20-64) are assigned to places of employment. Some adults do not work (according to
<a href="https://mn.gov/deed/data/current-econ-highlights/state-national-employment.jsp" target="_blank">an unemployment rate of 9.4% documented in Minnesota in May 2020</a> and the numbers of employees at businesses is based roughly on
<a href="https://www.naics.com/business-lists/counts-by-company-size/" target="_blank">NAICS Association data on business size</a>.

Users can vary the rate of COVID-19 transmission between coworkers, which
can represent protective measures to reduce transmission at workplaces.
For example, are all workers wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing
(lower transmission rate)? Or are workers not wearing masks and working in
close proximity to each other (higher transmission rate)?

**Directions**: Use the sliders to vary the rate of transmission
between coworkers, which is affected by using precautionary measures like
wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing in workplaces. In addition,
continue to use the classroom transmission sliders that determine the size of
classrooms for school-age children, and the rate of transmission between
students (i.e. the precautionary measures used to prevent transmission). Under
what conditions can school-age children attend school and adults go to work,
while keeping transmission to a minimum?

**Note**: Keep in mind that between-household transmission is NOT
included in this scenario. How would you expect between-household transmission
to change the conditions under which school-age children attend school and
adults go to work while keeping transmission to a minimum?
