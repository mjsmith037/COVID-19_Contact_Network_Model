Many disease models assume that everyone in a population contacts everyone else
at the same rate. However, we know this is not the case in the real world: for
example, people within the same household have lots of interactions with each
other so transmission is more likely to occur within a household than between
two households. Individuals are clustered into "households," with strong
connections between members of the same household representing the high
probability of transmission within households. When in lockdown (the default for
this scenario), all households are quite isolated.  However, there is background
transmission that happens as we go about essential daily life.

**Directions**: Use the sliders to see how changing the parameters for the
disease model affects the number of simulated COVID-19 cases and deaths, while
in lockdown. Note especially how difficult it is for the disease to spread when
there are so few strong interactions in the network. When you are ready, expand
one of the scenarios below. The disease parameters you have set here will apply
to that scenario as well.

**Note**: Parameters adjusted here will sync with the previous (sandbox) tab, and *vice versa*.
