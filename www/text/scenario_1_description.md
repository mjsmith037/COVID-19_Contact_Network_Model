The objective of this scenario is to show how between household interactions affect
COVID-19 transmission. Disease parameters are carried over from the previous scenario.

In this scenario, households may now be connected to represent between-household
interactions. Not all households interact with every other household; instead, users
can vary how many households merge into a "socially monogamous unit" of households
that only interact with each other.

**Directions**: Use the sliders to vary the number of different and
unique households the simulated households will interact with. In addition, use the
sliders to vary the degree of precautionary measures used during between-household
interactions (e.g. wearing masks, physical distancing, etc).

Users can also vary how easily COVID-19 is transmitted during between-household
interactions. For example, is everyone wearing masks and maintaining a physical
distance of 6 feet outdoors (lower transmission rate)? Or are people not wearing
masks and sitting close together indoors (higher transmission rate)?

Keep in mind that the between household interactions are "static" or stable in
this model, meaning that they do not change over time. How might model outcomes
vary if each household interacted with a different household each day?
