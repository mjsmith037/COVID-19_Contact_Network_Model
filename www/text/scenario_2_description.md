The objective of this scenario is to show how merging households (as in the previous
scenario) interacts with school-age children going to school to affect COVID-19 transmission outcomes.

In this scenario, users can vary between-household transmission as in the "Adding
Household Merging" scenario. In addition, users can now vary parameters related
to school-age children attending school. Users can vary the size of classrooms; in
other words, how many other students do school-age children interact with? In addition,
users can vary the rate of COVID-19 transmission between students, which can represent
protective measures to reduce transmission between children in schools. For example,
are all children wearing masks and maintaining a physical distance of 6 feet (lower
transmission rate)? Or are students not wearing masks and sitting close together (higher
transmission rate)?

**Directions**: Use the sliders to vary the size of classrooms and the
degree of precautionary measures used in schools (e.g. wearing masks, moving desks
further apart, etc). In addition, continue to use the between-household sliders that
determine the number of “merged” households, and the degree of precautionary measures
used during between-household interactions (e.g. wearing masks, physical distancing, etc).
How might between-household merging need to be limited to allow more children to return
to school and keep transmission as low as possible?
